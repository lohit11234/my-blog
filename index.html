    <h1>Hi</h1>
        
    <p>I was born in  ( May 7, 1998), better known online as MrBeast, is an American YouTuber, entrepreneur and philanthropist.[7] He has been credited with pioneering a genre of YouTube videos that center on expensive stunts.[8] He is also the co-creator of Team Trees, a fundraiser for the Arbor Day Foundation, which has raised over $72 million.[9][10] He is managed by the Dallas-based talent management company Night Media.[11]

Donaldson began posting videos to YouTube in early 2012 at the early age of 13,[11] under the handle "MrBeast6000"; his early content ranged from Let's Plays to "videos estimating the wealth of other YouTubers".[12] He went viral in 2017 after his "counting to 100,000" video earned tens of thousands of views in just a few days, and has become increasingly popular ever since, each of his videos gaining tens of millions of views.[12] Over time, his style of content diversified to include expensive challenge videos that reward thousands of dollars, donation videos involving a lot of money, videos either with arduous tasks or survival, and original vlogging videos.[13] Once his channel took off, Donaldson hired several of his childhood friends to help him run the growing brand. The MrBeast team is currently made up of 30 people.[14]

As of January 2021, Donaldson has more than 51 million subscribers on YouTube.[15] Aside from his main channel, Donaldson has several other YouTube channels, including MrBeast Shorts and MrBeast Gaming, the latter reaching over 10 million subscribers in less than one year.[16]

In 2019, he won the Breakout Creator by Streamy Awards. At the 12th Annual Shorty Awards in 2020, Donaldson won YouTuber of the Year. He was also one of the top 10 highest-paid YouTubers of 2020, alongside other famous YouTubers such as Markiplier, Ryan's World and Blippi.</p></section>
